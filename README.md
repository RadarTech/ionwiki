## Welcome to the ION Wiki!

The Lightning Network is here, and it's delivering **fast, free, and final Bitcoin payments**.

![](.gitbook/assets/ion_wiki_v2.png)

The number of nodes—and the amount of bitcoin—are increasing daily, and developers are creating new applications to experiment with the network and explore its possibilities.

But as the resources for building with Lightning proliferate, they are spread across numerous GitHub repositories, Subreddits, Slack and Telegram chats, and Medium articles.

ION wiki is a tool for **collecting the best Lightning tutorials, references, tools, and apps** in one place.
