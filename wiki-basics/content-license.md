# Platform & Content License

## Content Storage

The content in ION Wiki lives in GitHub: [https://github.com/RadarTech/ionwiki](https://github.com/RadarTech/ionwiki)

Anyone can make a local copy!  This is a significant advantage:

* your contributions won't be lost if a Mediawiki database goes offline
* straightforward porting between platforms that support Git-backed content storage
* contribute through the GitBook UI or your interface of choice using GitHub pull requests

## Choosing GitBook

After evaluating a dozen potential platforms for this wiki, we selected GitBook.

Advantages:

* GitBook supports editing in Markdown.
* GitBook supports Git-backed content storage.
* GitBook has a modern design and mobile friendliness.
* GitBook supports simple sign-in with GitHub or Google accounts.
* GitBook has rapid and responsive support.
* Because the Lightning Network is an open source software project, GitBook has allowed us to invite contributors to this wiki without paying the usual [per-user fees](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing).

Disadvantages:

* GitBook is a hosted solution.
* GitBook is not free and open source software.
* GitBook does not have a plugin systemâ€”the features it ships with are the features you get.
* GitBook is not as well-known, so contributors are less likely to be familiar with it.
* GitBook has limited user and content management tools.
  * e.g. users can't edit in the GitBook UI without signing up.
  * e.g. edits by certain users can't require approval before going live.
  * e.g. pages can't be protected from editing.

In total, we believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages for this particular project.  We will continue to evaluate other projects, like the upcoming [wiki.js v2](https://github.com/Requarks/wiki) beta, to see if they are a better fit.
