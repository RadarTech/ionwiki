description: Send Lightning payments without using an invoice!

# Key Send

Today \(2019-02-15\), you must acquire a one-time-use [Lightning invoice](../lightning/invoice.md) from a user in order to initiate a Lightning payment to them.  **Key Send** is a technology currently in development that will allow any node to send a payment to any other \(online\) node without requiring an invoice.

In [lnd](../../tutorials/nodes/lnd.md) version 0.7.0, **Sphinx Send** was renamed to **Key Send**.

## Implications

Today, a payer must receive a unique invoice from a payee for each payment:

Many tools have been built that LND users can host on a webserver in order to dispense invoices to users:

With Key Send, these dynamic invoice generators can be replaced with a static string or QR code that anyone can pay to.

## Progress

[LND](../../tutorials/nodes/lnd.md) has work-in-progress code that will enable Key Send:

This work is incomplete, but if you build two LND nodes from source using the `Roasbeef:new-eob-sphinx-send` feature branch, these nodes are able to exchange Sphinx Send payments.
