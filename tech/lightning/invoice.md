# Lightning Invoice

## Overview

An **invoice** is a request for payment on the Lightning Network. Invoices include the information necessary to complete a payment on the network, such as payment amount, which blockchain the invoice applies to, expiry date, payee [pubkey](../bitcoin/pubkey.md), [routing hints](payment-routing.md#routing-hints), and other information. Invoices are used to make payments on the Lightning Network, rather than using [Bitcoin-style addresses](../bitcoin/bitcoin-address-formats.md).

Invoices are commonly presented as alphanumerical strings or QR codes. In order to parse specific information from the request string, users can pass the string into a decoding tool:

* [https://ion.radar.tech/developers\#decode](https://ion.radar.tech/developers#decode)
* [https://lightningdecoder.com/](https://lightningdecoder.com/)
* [https://lndecode.com/](https://lndecode.com/)

## Invoice Components

Every Lightning invoice requires the following information in order to be valid:

* `destination`: The public key of the person receiving the LN payment.
* `payment_hash`: The hash of the preimage that is used to lock the payment. You can only redeem a locked payment with the corresponding preimage to the payment hash. This enables routing on the Lightning Network without trusted third parties.
* `num_satoshis`: The amount of satoshis to be paid.
* `expiry`: Time when your node marks the invoice as invalid. Default is 1 hour or 3600 seconds.
* `timestamp`: Time when the invoice was created.  This is measured in [seconds since 1970](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/11-payment-encoding.md#data-part).
* `cltv_expiry`: Delta to use for time-lock of CLTV extended to the final hop.
