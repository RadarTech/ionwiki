# Spacebit Satellite Client

Ever want to pay magic internet money to send `HELLO WORLD` to the entire world by bouncing it off a satellite? It's 2019 and this is a thing you can do. Bid testnet bitcoin using Lightning payments in order to send messages through a fleet of five [Blockstream satellites](https://blockstream.com/satellite/) that broadcast over pretty much the entire planet; anyone listening in with a satellite dish will get your message.

Sending a message with this service couldn't be easier, but verifying your message was sent requires tools that aren't as user-friendly.

## Receive Messages

Once you've installed the Blockstream satellite Python utilities, run the following to receive messages sent over the satellite by connecting directly to a server, no satellite dish needed:

```text
blockstream-satellite/api/examples$ ./demo-rx.py
```

Then run the following to grab and save these messages:

```text
blockstream-satellite/api/examples$ ./api_data_reader.py --plaintext

Open the saved plaintext files to read the messages!

{% hint style="info" %}
If messages are encrypted, the saved text will be unintelligible. Only unencrypted plaintext messages, like those sent via spacebit.live, will be readable!
{% endhint %}

## Set up a Satellite Dish

Yes, this is a thing that you can do!  Requires ~$200 worth of equipment and quite a bit of technical expertise.

Pavol Rusnak, CTO of SatoshiLabs \(creatos of the Trezor [hardware wallet](../../tech/research/hardware-wallets.md)\), even used the Blockstream satellites to relay the [Lightning Torch](lightning-torch.md):
