# Somebody Make This!

**What inspired you to build Somebody Make This!**  
  
It was something I've wanted to do for some time, because I had some ideas and, mostly for Lightning-powered apps, and wanted to see them done. If more people shared my judgement that these were interesting ideas then it would be an incentive for builders everywhere, including myself. I then expanded this idea to a broader scope, but I think it just remains the same.

**How did you build Somebody Make This!?**

I wrote a "smart contract" on [https://etleneum.com/](https://etleneum.com/) with some lines of Lua, wrote some tests for it, then begin writing a purely-client side interface to it with JavaScript.

**What were the biggest development challenges?**

The time. I didn't have much time to work on it on that specific weekend, I spent all the time I could, but it wasn't enough.

**What operational challenges have you run into since launch?**  
  
I didn't work on it since the hackathon. It needs quite a bit to be presentable. I spent too much of my brain on it during that weekend so I had to take a break. Only now I'm starting to think about it again.

**What are your plans for the project post hackathon?**

I'll finish the JavaScript interface and see if the community likes it.

**What projects are you most excited about this next year?**  
  
I'm actually expecting Bitcoin to get mainstream interest again with new high prices or financial turmoils in the real world, hoping that will bring more people to the Lightning economy.

**Where can we find code or working application of your project?**   
  
The "backend" code is at [https://etleneum.com/contract/94aj7mkrk](https://etleneum.com/contract/94aj7mkrk), the frontend will be published anytime soon.
